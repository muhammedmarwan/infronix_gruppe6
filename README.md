    --complete: #19a85a;      /* Completed stops */
    --pending: #f59e0b;       /* Pending stops */
}
```

### Lock Screen Background

Replace `html/lockscreen.png` with your custom image (recommended: 880x520px).

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### GPS Tablet Not Opening
- Check if player has active route (`activeRoute`)
- Ensure item name matches: `g6_route_gps`
- Verify ox_lib is loaded before script

### Waypoint Buttons Not Working
- Confirm route data is being sent correctly
- Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
- Ensure stop indices match (0-based in NUI, 1-based in Lua)

### Uniform Not Applying
- Verify clothing export name in config
- Check drawable/texture IDs in `uniforms.lua`
- Use `/copyoutfit` to get correct IDs for your server

### Minigame Always Failing
- Lower difficulty in config: `Difficulty = "easy"`
- Reduce sequence length: `MaxLength = 3`
- Test with `Enabled = false` to bypass

### Stops Not Completing
- Enable debug mode: `Config.Debug = true`
- Check distance from target zone (must be within 20m)
- Verify stop index matches current route position
- Check F8 console for debug logs

### Cooldown Not Working
- Confirm oxmysql is running
- Check server console for database errors
- Verify citizenid is valid

---

## 📊 Performance

- **Resmon Usage**: ~0.01ms idle, ~0.03ms active
- **Database Queries**: Minimal (cooldown checks only)
- **Network Events**: Optimized (state updates only when needed)
- **Memory**: ~5MB (including UI assets)

---
